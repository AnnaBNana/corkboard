# CORKBOARD

Corkboard was created in just under 24 hrs by myself and a team of other full stack developers for Hack Homelessness 2016 in San Jose, California. 

Corkboard is a tool intended to help reunite families separated from loved ones. Although it was built to target the homeless separated from their families, it has potential to be used in disaster situations, as well.
